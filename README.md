# hello-world
Simple assignment for CS-HU 250, Module 4
For this step in the assignment, the prompt calls for writing a bit about myself. With that being said, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Juan and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to study at Boise State University. Military service helped make this a reality for me. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and learning the inner workings of a field that has always interested me. To finish, I like long walks on the beach followed by an episode or three of House or The Office.
